## Things to know before testing

1. The ratings of restaurants and annual report should be generated periodically by analyzing fresh data. So after rating an order, the scores of the corresponding restaurant will NOT be changed immediately. The annual report should be generated once a year, so here we only show an example of the annual report from last year, but not a real-time report.
2.  order流程
3. By default, the user can only play the role of the owner of a restaurant called "Ta5ty", which means you can only validate the ingredients of each order received by this shop. We suggest you ordering a dish in "Ta5ty" and switch to "Restaurant" page to check orders and then validate the ingredients.
