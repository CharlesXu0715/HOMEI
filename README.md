## Page Structure

The mini-program consists of 4 main pages

- index 
- order
- knowledge
- account

You will also see a Restaurant page, which is designed only for restaurant operators. It is here only for demonstrative purpose, and will not appear in the operating version for customers. 

## Specialties

- On the knowledge page, you can find academic and popular articles cited from external sites with proper respect to copyrights.

- On the knowledge page, you can also find quizzes which will reward you discount coupons if you have obtained a good score. You can find your coupons in the coupon sector on the account page.

- Personalized annual report on the account page which calculates the average intake of each type of nutrition and gives practical advice so that they can form healthier dietary habits.
<<<<<<< Updated upstream

- You can customize your preferences both on the home page and the account page. In the preferences, you can choose your dietary habits such as halal, vegetarian and "on-diet", and your allergens which will modify the recommendations and allergy-warnings.

>>>>>>> Stashed changes
- If an order is placed (has to be in the Northwest Flavor Restaurant), this time, as the restaurant owner, you can check the incoming orders and select corresponding ingredients in your stock to cook them.
  
  - Now the restaurant owner selects the ingredients from a list of stock. In the ideal design, he can scan the bar code or the QR code on the ingredient package to record.
  
- Once an order is processed, the customer can find the trace information of it on the order page.

- Once an order is processed, the customer can rate this experience, especially the hygiene part, on the order page.
- As the restaurant owner, you can use the data analysis platform https://github.com/fxy233/DataAnalysis-Plateform.git to learn about different statistics and predictions according to the restaurant data.
  - Detailed information can be found on the README of https://github.com/fxy233/DataAnalysis-Plateform.git.

## Things to know before testing

1. The ratings of restaurants and annual report should be generated periodically by analyzing fresh data. So after rating an order, the scores of the corresponding restaurant will NOT be changed immediately. The annual report should be generated once a year, so here we only show an example of the annual report from last year, but not a real-time report.

2. The life cycle of an order: customer order a dish (current order in the order page) ---> restaurant receive this order and scan (validate) the ingredients  --->  we suppose that the customer has received and enjoyed the food (past order in the order page) ---> customer can later rate it

   Please note that we 

3. By default, the user can only play the role of the owner of a restaurant called "Northwest Flavor", which means you can only validate the ingredients of each order received by this shop. We suggest you ordering a dish in "Northwest Flavor" and switch to "Restaurant" page to check orders and then validate the ingredients. Of course, you can see dishes ordered by others in this section, don't feel confused if you see dishes that you haven't ordered.



## Known bug

When dealing with the orders on the restaurant page as the restaurant owner, due to the communication stability and fluency problem with the Wechat mini program database server, after you finish processing the last order in the page, there is a small chance that a display error will occur, please refresh or re-enter the page to return to normal. Thank you for your comprehension.
